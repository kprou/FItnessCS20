        <h1> College Athletes Program </h1>
        <p>
                SMEK Fitness realizes and appreciates the amount of time and effort 
                college athletes put into their sports, some playing year round and 
                missing out on job and internship opportunites in order to pursue 
                excellence in their sport. We also know that often athletes are only 
                in the area during certain parts of the year. It is because of these 
                factors and many others that we've created the SMEK College Athletes 
                Program. The program requires applicants to list their name, sport(s), 
                college or university, and their year of graduation. Once accepted, 
                athletes will have a full membership, complete with access to all of 
                our facilities and classes, for just 70% of the cost. Additionally, 
                we have waived our cancellation fee in order to make cancellation 
                upon returning to school as easy as possible.
