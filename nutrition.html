        <h2> Our Emphasis on Nutrition </h2>
        <p> At SMEK Fitness group, we emphasize to our athletes that their self improvement doesn't end when they walk out the doors. We offer nutritionist consultations, on-site healthy options, and info sources such as this one to give you all the information you need to reach all your fitness goals. </p>
        
        <h3> Eating Healthy </h3>
        <p> You're probably heard of the five major food groups. </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 100px;">
                <li><strong>Carbohydrates </strong> are broken by your body into glucose and use to provide you body with energy. Eating high fiber, complex carbs will provide you with more longlasting energy throughout your day. Simple carbs like fruit snacks can still be good as a quick pre-workout pick me up, but they won't do you any good after two hours. <br>&emsp;<i>Includes grains, oats, pasta, bread.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Proteins </strong> are used by your body to repair damaged muscles and, if carb sources are depleted, for basic energy. You really want your body to be able to build upon the muscle it has, so eating enough protein is important to make sure you see success in your workouts. <br>&emsp;<i> Includes meats, seafood, legumes, and dairy.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Fats </strong> are neccessary for a healthy diet. Your body relies on them for absorbtion of vitamins and hormone regulation. Your body relies on Vitamins A, B, C, D, and zinc to function fluidly, so making sure you're eating enough healthy fats is essential for skin and hair health. <br>&emsp;<i> Indludes nuts, avacado, and natural oils.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Fruits </strong> are a great source of many of the nutrients described above. They're also a quick and easy carb to eat right before or even mid-workout. Drinking smoothies, adding some orange juice to your daily breakfast, or grilling peaches alongside your chicken can be a great way for you to work fruits into your diet. <br>&emsp;<i> Includes fruits, berries, and juices.</i></li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables </strong> provide us with antioxidants and phytochemicals, which help the body recover from structural damge and keep all our organs functioning smoothly. <br>&emsp;<i> Includes, broccoli, kale, sprouts, and </i> </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Eating Right </h3>
        <p> With that general knowledge, you also have to know how to apply those guidelines to your own body, lifestyle, and fitness goals.  </p>
